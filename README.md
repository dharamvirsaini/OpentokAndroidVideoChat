# OpentokAndroidVideoChat

# Android app completely based on Opentok platform and is audio/video only. Following are the main highlights of this app:

1) User authentication using Phone number verification(Firebase SDK)  
2) Syncing phone contacts with the app database(Phone contacts who are using the app are only shown in the app)  
3) Push notifications to show incoming call alerts(Using Firebase Push Notification services)  
4) Profile image and name syncing with database.  

# I have used Glide open source library because of the following:  

a) Handling ImageView recycling and cancelation in an adapter.  
b) Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.  
c) Automatic memory and disk caching.  

# Additional points covered are:  

a). Based on MVC architecture  
b). Non UI blocking Code  
c). Image Caching  
d). Memory Management
